# PoreWorld


Repository of the second guided project of the course "Scientific Computing Tools for Advanced Mathematical Modelling" AY 2023/2024.

# Introduction

Porous media are materials containing voids, or pores, that can be filled with fluids such as air, water, oil, or a mixture of different fluids. They are widely present in different fields of application, from technology to nature. We will focus on geological porous media, typically sedimentary layers and porous rocks in general.

This project aims at developing innovative scientific computing tools for porous media.

# Rules

Each group needs to create its branch of the main branch (name_of_your_new_branch=Surname1Surname2Surname3). 

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :

$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
Push the branch on github :

$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]

Please, upload just the code needed for the project evaluation and avoid uploading unnecessary material (e.g. images and additional data structures).
